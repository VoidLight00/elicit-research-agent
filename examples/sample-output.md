## 🔬 Elicit Research Results: Effects of caffeine on cognitive performance

### AI Summary

Caffeine has been consistently shown to **enhance various aspects of cognitive performance**, particularly alertness, attention, and reaction time. Most studies report positive effects at moderate doses (75-300mg), with diminishing or negative returns at higher doses. The effects are most pronounced in **sleep-deprived individuals** and during tasks requiring sustained attention. However, caffeine's impact on higher-order cognitive functions like complex reasoning and creativity remains **mixed and context-dependent**.
